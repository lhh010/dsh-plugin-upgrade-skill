# S12 Global upgrade EBUSY + downgrade trap (reference answer)

## 1. Attempt 1 root cause: running dsh host process holds an OS file lock on koffi.node

The dsh web host process (node.exe PID 42432 in the evidence) loaded `@koromix/koffi` — a
**native FFI addon** compiled as a `.node` binary — at startup. On Windows (and most OSes),
once a native `.node` module is loaded into a process, the OS holds an **exclusive file lock**
on the binary file until the process exits. `npm install -g` needs to copy/replace that file
to update the package, and the copy fails with `EBUSY`.

**Why refreshing the browser page doesn't help**: a page refresh only reloads the SPA
(the web GUI in the browser). The **host process** (the Node.js process running dsh) is a
separate process that stays alive — and it's the host process that loaded koffi. The lock
is held at the OS process level, not the browser level.

**Correct sequence**: fully **stop dsh** (close the web app AND the host process — `Ctrl+C`
in the terminal running dsh, or kill the node.exe process), THEN run the npm install, THEN
restart dsh.

## 2. Attempt 2 root cause: unpinned npm install resolves to `latest` dist-tag

The combined command `npm install -g @deepseek-ai/dsh @deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-tui` does
NOT preserve the currently-installed version of `@deepseek-ai/dsh`. Without a version
specifier, npm resolves the package to its **`latest` dist-tag** — which, per the evidence
(`npm-dist-tags.txt`), points to `0.1.1-rc.2` (the stable release channel), NOT to
`0.1.2-alpha.6` (which is on the `alpha` dist-tag).

So the user's pinned alpha.5 install was silently replaced by the older rc.2 — a **downgrade**
disguised as an install.

## 3. Safe upgrade commands

```sh
# 1. Stop dsh completely (host process, not just the browser tab)
# 2. Upgrade dsh with the EXACT version pinned
npm install -g @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.2-alpha.6
# 3. Install the TUI plugin (separate command, dsh already handled)
npm install -g @deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-tui
# 4. Verify
dsh --version    # should print 0.1.2-alpha.6
# 5. Restart
dsh web
```

## 4. Prevention: plugin README authors must pin versions in install commands

The root cause of attempt 2 is that a third-party plugin README showed an install command
with an **unpinned** `@deepseek-ai/dsh`. This is a footgun for every user who follows it.
README install commands should ALWAYS pin the version:

```sh
# BAD (resolves to latest = rc.2, silently downgrades alpha users):
npm install -g @deepseek-ai/dsh @deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-tui

# GOOD (pins the version the plugin was tested against):
npm install -g @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.2-alpha.6 @deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-tui
```

The rule: **an install command that can change what the user already has must specify
the exact version it intends to deliver.**
